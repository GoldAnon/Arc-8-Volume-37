The mass evacuation of the Imperial Capital of Lupugana, accompanied by the retreat on a scale unparalleled in history. 

The casualties inflicted upon the civilians and the military were by no means small, but nevertheless, the present outcome was far less severe than had been originally anticipated; the factor responsible for that was the mindset by which the Imperial citizens lived their daily lives. 

――The people of the Empire must be strong.

This teaching and philosophy had penetrated into each and every person of the Empire, and many had succeeded in taking the best possible steps of surviving in this extreme situation. 

In addition to the success achieved through such individual readiness and actions, the fact that the various plans that were made for times of emergency, like the coupled dragon carriages, had been fully functional was also significant. These were the achievements of the person who had perceived the arrival of the Great Disaster, originally predicted by the Stargazer, as an imminent threat and had made the proper preparations.

The fact that said person was unable to make it to the fight against that very Great Disaster could only be called a bitter disappointment.

???: [Still, that selflessness has kept the Empire alive! I express nothing but the utmost respect, General First-Class Chisha…!]

With a voice akin to a roar, Kafma Irulux, with thorns shooting forth from both hands, mowed down the hordes of the undead, fighting hard to protect the road that led to the Fortified City to his back. 

The Imperial Army that had been deployed in increments along the highway leading from the Imperial Capital to the Fortified City, while supporting the evacuation of the retreating Imperial citizens, had been gradually falling back towards the city, with the aim of merging with the group within the fort. 

Among the Generals who had participated in the decisive battle for the Imperial Capital, the role assigned to Kafma was of the utmost importance, and although he himself will not admit to it, it can be said that it worked towards determining the survival of the Empire. 

The casualties among the refugees, was influenced by the determination of the Imperial citizens; the defense of the Fortified City, was influenced by the preparations made in advance; and the high morale of the imperial soldiers and the minimization of losses, was greatly influenced by the valiant efforts of Kafma.

Serving as the rear guard to the formation that was gradually retreating towards the Fortified City, he used the power of the Insects he had absorbed to slow down the advance of the undead, an achievement worthy to be left behind in the annals of history. 

However, all of that was contingent on whether the Vollachian Empire escaped destruction. 

Thus, Kafma’s expectation-defying achievements were also the result of fighting without taking his own survival into consideration. 

Kafma: [――Hk.]

As far as the eye could see, the army of undead had blanketed the vast plain.

While striking them with thorns, light bullets, and wind blades, Kafma gritted his teeth against the appetite of the "worm" that was eating away at him from the inside, and bit down on his own urge to scream.

The Insect Cage Tribe can use the power of the Insects that live together within their bodies, and depending on the type of Insect taken in, they can manifest a wide variety of abilities and combat techniques. However, it must be remembered that the relationship between the Insect Cage Tribe and the Insects is a symbiotic one. 

It is not a one-sided relationship, nor is it an assimilation.

Naturally, the Insect seeks compensation from its host for its work. That is the host's mana or life force, and if found insufficient, their flesh and blood.

Already, more than fifty hours had passed since Kafma had decided to fight to the death, and during that time, he was literally forced to go without food or drink.

Although his consciousness was sharpened like never before by his awakened fighting spirit, to the Insects inside his body the host's state of mind was irrelevant. It just lodges a complaint to the host about the fact that it is hungry, runs out of patience if they refuse to lend an ear, and starts to devour their flesh. 

Kafma: [The reneging on the promise is from my side. But still…!]

Presently, he could not leave the line of fire, nor could he allow himself to fall over.

The Empire had many other dependable warriors besides him, but Kafma prided himself on being the bravest when facing death. He wanted to prove that his pride was real. 

For that reason――,

Kafma: [To let myself fall here, I――]

“Won't allow it”, rousing himself with those words, just as he was about to step forth ready to have his organs completely devoured.

From behind, a large pam grabbed his shoulder.

And, the one to whom that palm belonged was――,

???: [Fall back, General Second-Class Kafma! You have fulfilled your duty adequately!]

The voice was loud as if shouting at someone, but for this person, that volume was the norm.

Being told thus with a voice akin to being hit with a gust of wind, Kafma stared wide-eyed, at the giant in golden armor standing next to him―― Goz Ralfon.

Holding a mace that only he could handle, the arrival of Goz at the scene surprised Kafma.

Kafma: [Why did you step forward, General First-Class Goz? A general First-Class should be overseeing things from the fortress…]

Goz: [There is High Countess Dracoy over there! Even without me barricading myself in the fortress, that woman can handle the troops skillfully! More importantly, I can be more of a service to His Excellency on the battlefield!]

Kafma: [――. In that case, I will accompany you.]

The heart, on the verge of cracking with determination and earnestness, sought to reinforce itself with Goz's appearance. However, Kafma’s plea, was stopped by Goz with a “No”.  

Then, Goz extended his thick fingers and pressed them against Kafma's chest,

Goz:[Within you, there is a sound of stirring and devouring. It seems like the “insects” are out of control. If you were to be consumed entirely, it would be a significant loss!]

Kafma: [That may be… But, everything I've built up is for this battle!]

Goz: [Kafma Irulux！Death is not redemption!!]

Kafma: [――Hk]

Head-to-head this time, getting slapped with an angry voice, caused Kafma's entire body to tremble.

For just this time,  even the "insects" that were eagerly devouring Cafma's body halted their movements, cowed by the fierce aura of Goz standing before them.

Looking down at Kafma, Goz, with his scarred bearded face, expressed his anger.

Goz:[I understand that you still seek to atone for the rebellion orchestrated by your kin, along with Balleroy! But! Atonement can not be achieved through death! You must live!]

Kafma: [General First-Class Goz]

Goz: [Even after the Great Disaster subsides, the Empire will not instantly return to normal! Both you and I can still be of service to Your Excellency! That's why!]

Realizing that this was not a place to sacrifice his life, Kafma, with his innermost feelings laid bare, tightly closed his eyes and deeply bowed his head before Goz.

Goz: “What, anyhow, it's not an easy battle for you to simply step back and conclude. Your turn will come again soon! Until then, eat, rest, and regain your strength!]

Kafma: [Understood. General First-Class Goz, I entrust this place to you…]

Goz: [No need to say it. ――I too, have pent-up frustrations!]

With a wide grin at Kafma's strained words, Goz aimed the mace he had shouldered towards the enemy lines.

Handling the excessively heavy weapon that no one but him would be able to handle with ease, Goz entire body overflowed with a tremendous fighting spirit, so much so that one would think it was visible.

Once again, feeling the apprehension from the "insects" within his own body, Kafma fell into deep thought.

Chisha Gold, who demonstrated an unfathomable strategy to prevent the destruction of the Empire, and Goz Ralfon, who frightens the "insects" just by standing with his tremendous spirit were those who had reached the position of General First-Class of the Vollachian Empire were no less transcendent than any other.

Contemplating the past he had almost been ranked alongside and the future that he must be part of――

"――The Empire is strong. We won't be easily taken by the undead or the disaster."

Otto: [It is not simply a matter of being strong or weak, but it is rather a matter of quantity, and one that is difficult to deal with. Fortunately, the supplies and defenses of the Fortified City are abundant, but… we cannot withstand such a siege for long.]

Serena: [You speak your mind clearly. Well, I certainly have a better impression of you than those who can't express their opinions for fear of offending others. If only your cunning could be matched by your military strength, then you would be more to my liking.]

Berstetz: [High Countess Dracroy, let us not digress any further.]

Berstetz, chiding her, glared at Serena with thin, thread-like eyes. Serena shrugged her shoulders under that gaze, and Otto, who was being flirted with, let out a small sigh.

The setting was the command room of the great fortress, and those facing each other were responsible for leading the full-scale defensive battle of the city.

From the reports of the lookouts, it was confirmed that the Fortified City of Garkla had entered a state of being ready for combat around the great fortress.

The delaying force that had been holding back the enemy's advance had also joined the city, and staged within a city that boasted the Vollachian Empire's strongest defenses, the largest siege in the history of the Empire was about to begin.

Anastasia: [That bein' said, ya typically win a siege by waitin' for reinforcements, but we can't be countin' on that this time, y'know. The only way we can be sayin' we've won is…]

???: [――When Natsuki-kun and His Excellency the Emperor splendidly defeat the enemy's mastermind. Until then, our role is to struggle to ensure that Vollachia does not fall.]

Anastasia: [If Vollachia goes down, then Kararagi 'n Lugunica are gonna be in hot water too… What the heck, it's really a battle for the survival of the world, ain't it.]

Placing her hand on her white cheek, Anastasia broke into a graceful smile as she spoke, and the fox scarf that chimed in with her let out a sigh of exasperation.

This peculiar sight, as it turned out, was Anastasia's Spirit companion, the fox scarf. They needed as many capable heads as they could get, as this truly was an all-out war.

Serena: [The first question is how long the city's defenses will hold.. General Second-Class Irulux has been replaced by General First-Class Ralfon. Despite his appearances, he's a man capable of delicate and skillful work. He should follow the directive of sparing the lives of the zombies as much as possible, but…]

Berstetz: [It is unrealistic to consistently expect non-lethality. This goes not just for General First-Class Goz, but for everyone else. If there is any hope for us to hold onto…]

Anastasia: [I'm wonderin', maybe it's Natsuki-kun's group of friends.]

Otto: [I think so, too.]

Anastasia and Otto exchanged glances, aligning their opinions with each other.

The topic the duo raised concerned the members of the Pleiades Battalion, the unexpected defensive force of the Fortified City. 

The black-haired boy, who had formed a miraculously friendly relationship with Vincent, led this group. They had significantly aided the refugees with their strong solidarity and mysterious combat abilities.

Currently, the boy in question was headed to the Imperial Capital with Vincent and the others, leaving the group under the leadership of Gustav Morello―― led by the stern member of the Multi-Arm Tribe, the Gladiators were wreaking havoc.

Echidna: [Their morale is high, and their ability to be non-lethal is impressive. I often think to myself, Natsuki-kun is a genius at bringing what is needed to where it is needed.]

Otto: [Yes, that seems to be his one redeeming quality. Though I wish he would just make deliveries or build bridges, instead of recklessly running into the most dangerous of situations.]

Anastasia: [But ya know, ain't that more of a problem on Emilia-san's part? If Emilia-san starts runnin' ahead, Natsuki-kun's gotta run too, ain't no way around it.]

Anastasia shook her head with a "good grief" gesture, and Otto dropped his shoulders in agreement.

While watching this exchange and the development of relationships would be interesting, spending too much time on it would draw a stern look from the Prime Minister.

Serena cleared her throat, and after capturing everyone's attention,

Serena: [As per our prior agreement, our combat strategy is strictly to hold a siege, a defensive battle. If defeating one specific opponent could resolve all of this, I'd consider assassination as an option, but…]

Berstetz: [As it stands, let us consider His Excellency and those headed to the Imperial Capital as the arrows of assassination.]

Serena: [That's how it is. ――It's a total war.]

At Serena's words, there was a palpable tension in the air, and everyone's expression became more intense.

The light-hearted banter from just before had ended, and from that point on, it would be a world where they needed to exert their utmost efforts.

The Imperial Generals, the rebel fighters, the Gladiators of the Pleiades Battalion, the People of Shudraq, and even the allies of the Kingdom and the emissaries from the City-States, all part of a battle that utilized everything at their disposal.

And, as the first hurdle――,

Serena: [We'll be counting on you, envoys from the City-States.]

Anastasia: [Sure thing, leave it to me. ――As far as I can remember, he ain't ever let me down, y'know.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――Amidst the warfare waged in the Vollachian Empire, what exactly was the aspect that differed most greatly to that of other countries?

If one were to ignore the resolve harbored by the Imperial Soldiers, or their fiery spirit to contend in battle, the answer to that was plain and simple―― the potential for aerial combat.

The technique of flying dragon taming, which was absent from other nations, and the fact that a large number of flying dragons inhabited the Empire exclusively, were aspects of their superiority that were thoroughly demonstrated in warfare.

It was a fact that went without even needing to be thought, but merely being able to fly through the air was something that proved advantageous in war.

In fact, the Fortress City of Guaral, which was said to boast high defensive capabilities among other cities of similar size, had fallen into a state of utter destruction due to a flock of flying dragons commanded by the Flying Dragon General, Madelyn Eschart.

By merely throwing things down from an unreachable position, a battle would become one-sided.

That remained a threat even for the Fortified City of Garkla, a city surrounded by a towering wall. 

However――,

???: [Fire――!!!]

Lined up atop the wall, Shudraqian warriors with bows at the ready fired arrows into the air in unison.

The barrage of arrows covered the sky, offering no escape, and directly pierced by those countless attacks was the flock of undead flying dragons that had been ordered to assail the stout city from the skies above, and was soaring through the air as they drew ever closer.

Pierced by the merciless blows, one after another the heads of undead flying dragons shattered before they turned to dust and fell to the ground.

Among them, there were some that continued to fly without paying any mind to the attacks, but――,

Shudraqian: [Take them down!]

Shudraqian: [It’s best if they fall to the ground~.]

Struck by a blow from an arrow incomparable to a normal arrow in terms of length and thickness, one of them was blown to smithereens in mid-air, and met its end.

In response to aerial combat, the Shudraq boasted unrivaled strength―― the experience of the aforementioned crushing defeat in the Fortress City had a great impact on the fighting style of these women.

Had they not suffered that defeat, the Shudraq would likely have not been fighting the undead flying dragons here.

Giving meaning to each and every one of their battles, the People of Shudraq had fought since the start of the Empire’s upheaval, which began with Vincent Vollachia’s ousting.

And,in response to the morale of those women――,

Shudraqian: [Go get them! Guy with the handsome face!]

Man: [I shall do my best to meet your expectations. ――Al Clauseria.]

Weaving an incantation with a fine tone of voice, the tip of the Knight’s sword traced the sky, and following that trajectory a rainbow light was born, thwarting the path of the undead flying dragons.

Despite the beauty of the rainbow aurora, it became a barrier that rejected anything and everything.

Man: [Wholly different from when they were still buds, these girls have blossomed, and this is their glimmer.]

In the blink of an eye, the skies of the Fortified City were engulfed in an aurora of rainbow―― however, the size and extent of that rainbow were enough to defend around half of the extensive Fortified City.

The Imperial Soldiers fighting on the front lines, as well as those who were also responsible for protecting the city from atop the wall, were left speechless by that extraordinary combat capability, and they could not help but feel a surge of courage from that reliability. 

Sensing that swell of morale, the Knight who yielded that rainbow―― Julius Juukulius, waved the hem of his kimono, and looked up to the sky once again.

With a white scar underneath his left eye, the dauntless young man participated in the battle out of honor, and nevertheless trained his gaze upon what he ought to do without an iota of hesitation. His eyes were fixed upon the sky, upon the vast lands where the undead drew near, believing in the efforts of his friend, who was headed even further beyond――,

Julius: [――I shall carry out my own duties. I hope you also do so to the fullest, Subaru.]
