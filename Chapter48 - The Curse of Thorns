*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

——The name Eugard Vollachia, Emperor of the Briar, was known not just within the Vollachian Empire, but also far and wide across the rest of the world.

The reason for this mark he left on the history of the Empire was the tale of his tragic love, Iris and the King of Thorns.

The kind-hearted girl named Iris, the feared Emperor of Vollachia, the King of Thorns, and the tale that told of their meeting and parting, the tragic nature of the ending struck a chord within the hearts of many readers.

The preordained meeting of two people, and their first parting. After the rebellion of his vassals, the King of Thorns was ousted from the throne and reunited with Iris, and hand-in-hand the two began their rebellion—— it was a long, long time in the making, and although the historical fact differed from the telling of the story, the most important core portion of the story, that of two people who fell deeply in love with each other, had not changed and would continue to be told.

Because of this, the tale of Iris and the King of Thorns and their everlasting love continued to be beloved.

However, because of the telling of this tale of tragic love that lit a fire within the hearts of everyone, a part of the original historical truth had become unknowingly concealed and hidden.

Iris and the King of Thorns, the two of them spending their time together in peaceful love, was not the case.

During a tumultuous time, in an Empire which blended treachery and lamentations, they spent their days together risking their lives, constantly fighting for the sake of their desired future, their love burning.

And indeed, Iris and the King of Thorns were able to overthrow the entirety of the Vollachian Empire, finally able to accomplish their repossession of the Empire. ——Of course, the tragedy which followed need not be said. 

But, before that tragedy occurred, the two had indeed achieved their goal.

With her compassionate heart and her devoted way of being, Iris won many allies over to her side. With Iris by his side, the King of Thorns waged a war befitting the Emperor of Vollachia.

A war befitting the Emperor of Vollachia—— remaining unchanged from ancient times, this was the personification of the Vollachian law of iron and blood. In other words, the proof of power.

——Emperor of the Briar Eugard Vollachia, the most powerful Emperor in the history of the Empire.

???: [Fuck youuu!!]

Roaring this, an angry voice burst from his throat as Groovy leaped high into the air, throwing his sickle and chain as its handle was cut in half.

A second later, the sickle and chain which had left his hand burst into deep red flames midair.

If he had hesitated for even a moment, those flames would have consumed him. His hair instinctually stood on end as he realized he had nearly been burned to death. But, there was no time to feel relief.

Eugard: [Thoust dances well, pup. However, if this is to be a dance then mine own star is far more impressive.]

In a detached, emotionless tone he spoke fondly of his lover, red streaks blooming in profusion with his attacks.

The weapon he wielded, which received the blows from the sickle and chain and made it instantly burst into flame without even permitting an exchange of blows, was truly the worst—— as one would expect from a treasured sword which bore the name of the Empire, it wasn’t just it’s sharpness, but even it’s special characteristic caused excessive trouble.

Groovy: [His Excellency the fucking Emperor could’ve at least given me a nice close look at it!]

As no one beside the rightful owner could possess the treasured sword, opportunities to see the real thing were few and far between.

While spitting out his dissatisfaction at his treatment as a General First-Class, Groovy made use of his opponent’s small stature and his own nimble body to quickly evade the crimson strikes, dodging, dodging, and dodging once again.

If you can’t take the hit then evade it, this was the primitive yet optimum solution to use against this enemy. If it had been Goz or Moguro here, then they would not have dodged, been hit by the strike, and reached the end of their life in a fiery blaze.

The aftermath of the slashes which incinerated the cityscape, Groovy’s nose took in the burning smell as he continued to dodge the crimson sword’s cutting technique. However, he was still unable to catch his breath.

Even if he dodged the Yang Sword which burned the world itself, the next flash of blackness would bisect the world.

Groovy: [——Hk.]

Not even his habitual cursing was able to escape his mouth.

As the barrage of powerful swings came from the Yang Sword, he twisted his body and with a flash unleashed the Fiend Sword, causing Groovy’s fur to stand on end as he ducked and the blade scythed just a centimeter above his head.

The result of this slash did not end with just his head not flying off.

Along the path which the sword had traced, dozens of meters in front of where the stroke had cut, the street of the Imperial Capital slanted diagonally, a series of severed buildings crumbling in its wake.

Such sharpness was plainly absurd, even making a dedicated sheath for the blade had been rife with difficulties, such was the power of the Fiend Sword Murasame.

This Fiend Sword which displayed such power naturally required a suitable price in order to be wielded. If one were an ordinary person, it was an untread area which could cost them their very life.

Groovy: [That boom boom booming, you have some nerve to swing it around so fucking casually…!]

Eugard: [Dost thou hold concern for I whilst we face off against each other? If such is the case then your concerns are unneeded. Diminutive beings such as thyself need only worry over themselves. For mine worries, my star is sufficient enough.]

Groovy: [You’re just spewing shit!]

In his right hand, Yang Sword Vollachia, and in his left hand, Fiend Sword Murasame.

This foe who wielded the two worst swords that Groovy could possibly imagine and who hadn’t given his name, so long as he held the Yang Sword without bursting into flames it showed that he was worthy of being the rightful owner of the blade.

Additionally, green hair with a crown of thorns, this situation in which the dead became undead—— the identity of the person wielding the two worst blades, a terrible possibility rose to the surface of Groovy’s mind as he spat out an endless string of curses.

Hence——,

Groovy: [Eugard Vollachia…]

Eugard: [Even if thou dost not call out to minself, I am aware of mine own personage. However, for recognising mineself even though we art separated by time I must deliver praise.]

Bearing blades of instant death in both hands, he states this in a crushing voice to his foe that had opened up some distance.

And then from the front, the undead, standing on the burning wreckage of the building, jerked his chin solemnly at Groovy's call.

At that undead―― at Eugard's reply, Groovy's attitude worsened and he snorted.

Groovy: [Even so, I'm still a book reader among the fucking First-Class Generals. And for fuck's sake, I'm one of the "Nine Divine Generals”!]

Eugard: [“Nine Divine Generals…Ah, that is still in existence, that profession is.]

Groovy: [It's like it all fucking vanished in your generation.]

In front of Eugard, who may or may not be interested in his inflectionless speech, Groovy put his arms behind his waist and drew two hatchets from it and held them at the ready.

He still had more cursed tools left. The problem wasn’t his remaining amount of cursed tools, but rather how much life he had left.

Groovy: [――――]

He looked down at his own chest at the edge of his vision,  while keeping his gaze fixed on Eugard. Like before, his chest, filled with organs, was writhing with sharp transparent poking thorns.

It was good that he had hastily prepared to deal with the "Curse of Thorns" that poisoned him and ate away at his heart, but this daredevil strategy was not designed for the long haul.

The "Curse of Thorns" was, by the looks of it, a powerful curse that indiscriminately engulfed the latter half of the body, centering on the user. Therefore, he predicted that the user would be the kind to hide while focusing on activating and maintaining the curse.

That was naive. Very naive. His guess was way off, and the enemy was not hiding, but rather wielding powerful weapons with impunity ――no, the weapons were indeed powerful, but the struggle was not only because of those weapons.

It was because the wielder of the weapons was a person of extraordinary ability.

In the current Vollachian Empire, the status of General First-Class indicated the position of the "Nine Divine Generals".

It was revived by the current emperor, Vincent Vollachia, and has been revived and disappeared several times in history, but it was during the reign of Eugard Vollachia that the organization of "Nine Divine Generals" was first lost.

Why was the "Nine Divine Generals" organization eradicated during Eugard's reign?

That’s because――,

Eugard: [――It cannot be helped. Although weaker than I, they tried to take the life of Mine Star.]

That was the reason why every single one of the "Nine Divine Generals" at that time was killed by the hands of the "Emperor of the Briar" himself.

Of course, there was no Groovy in the "Nine Divine Generals" at that time, nor were there transcendent figures such as Cecilus and Arakiya. But even so, he did not think that the "Nine Divine Generals" were so weak that they could not hold a candle to him today.

In short――,

Groovy: [――Fucking short-term battles!]

Eugard: [Do not pile on the impure words from earlier. It would be impious.]

Groovy's body flew to Eugard, kicking up a trail of slashes through the remaining streets.

Groovy was holding two hatchets, and Eugard was poised to intercept him with the "Yang Sword," pointing not at his weapons but at his words and actions. Groovy furiously bared his fangs at his opponent, who was ready to intercept him, and struck with his hatchets in a vertical attack.

It was naturally blocked by the "Yang Sword," which was raised in the air as if hung up, but that was just what he wanted.

Eugard: [Mm.]

Eugard's face cracked  at the moment the "Yang Sword" collided with the hatchets. Literally.

The crack on the cheek of his pale, prim face was proof that Groovy's blow had passed through to his opponent.

Groovy: [It worked, thank fuck!]

Groovy laughed with a sidelong glance at the puzzled Eugard as the hatchets blew up in a blaze of flames.

To avoid the spread of fire, he let go of the hatchets the moment it hit the "Yang Sword," but the effect of the cursed tools, to hit the target with an impact rather than cutting him, was activated.

It was originally created to kill opponents wearing thick armor or steel helmets. The blade of the hatchet vibrates so finely that it could not be seen, and even the slightest contact with the hatchet blade will cause the hatchet to move through to the body of the opponent, crushing bones and organs.

That would be lethal damage for a living person,but he wasn't sure how effective it would be for the undead――,

Eugard: [Enthralling. But if thou cannot continue onward――]

Groovy: [Who d'ya think you're talking to? I've got a fuckton of curse tools left!]

As if one or two axes were not enough, Groovy pulled out two more hatchets and held them up in both hands. Hearing Groovy's answer, Eugard raised his eyebrows slightly on his cracked face.

Eugard, too, turned to avoid being hit and then fired a slash. Groovy also avoided the slash by jumping, and threw the hatchet in succession.

Groovy: [Ora ora ora ora ora ora ora!]

Eugard: [――――]

A momentary battle between the barking Groovy and the silent Eugard turned into a fierce struggle.

As Groovy's cursed tools were freely thrown, Eugard continued to fire his duo of "Yang Sword" and "Fiend Sword" in return.

At a glance, the battle appeared to be evenly matched, but in reality Groovy was at a big disadvantage.

His remaining strength, his number of remaining curse tools, and the lethality of both of their weapons were all against them.

The deadly poison that coursed through his blood was draining his life, and the curse tools that he kept using would eventually run out. While these curse tools may cause great damage when they hit, the opponent's sword was certain death if it were to hit.

Even to an untrained eye, it was obvious which side had the advantage, and even more so for the two parties involved in the fight.

That was why Groovy capitalized on being at a disadvantage.

Groovy: [I’ll fucking show you something.]

Groovy did not consider himself to be particularly strong among the "Nine Divine Generals".

He once prided himself on being the strongest in Vollachia. However, after being recruited by Vincent and seeing others who had been given the same rank of "General," those illusions vanished.

He desired to be strong but did not want to step out of line and was not qualified to do so.

He fell short of Cecilus with his strength, Arakiya with her explosive power, Olbart with his versatility, Chisha with his intellect, Goz with his command as a General, Moguro with their survivability, Yorna with her unorthodoxy, Madelyn with her anti-army performance, and Balleroy when it came to anti-personal performance.

That was Groovy's self-assessment and the culmination of becoming a General.

However, aside that, Groovy had strengths that other Generals did not possess.

――Groovy excelled in his relentless dedication and method of killing his opponents.

Groovy: [chomp]

During his throw, a large amount of blood poured out of Groovy's mouth with a bloodshot look in his eyes.

This was the result of the poison circulating throughout his body, causing blood vessels to break, which then overflowed as they broke all over his body. Eugard's expression did not waver at the sight of Groovy vomiting blood.

They, too, were a master martial artist, and they must have known that Groovy was approaching them with some means to resist the Curse of Thorns. This was placing a burden on Groovy's body that he would not be able to endure for long.

The blood he vomited only confirmed this belief.

Even if Eugard's blade did not reach him, Groovy would die of exhaustion on his own. Indeed, Eugard must have discerned this with his insight.

Because of this, it would be impossible to avoid the mist of Groovy's blood that was spewed from his mouth.

Eugard: [――――]

Eugard frowned slightly, evaporating the mist of blood with the flames of the Yang Sword.

The blood contained the poison that Groovy had taken in, but even if they were exposed to it, the damage to his opponent would be negligible. The goal is not to poison his opponent.

It was to apply Groovy's blood. ――it was successfully applied to his sleeve, which he couldn't shake off.

Groovy: [Like fish in a fucking barrel.]

Immediately after, Groovy smiled, his bloody fangs showing. Around Eugard ――the countless hatchets he had dodged so far drew close to him as if pulled by a string.

It is a guided projectile from the Curse Tool "Blood Hatchet," which used Groovy's blood as a medium to acquire its target.

Eugard: [This is…]

Eugard dodged the incoming blood hatchet, but then saw it circle around and come back again.

Eugard, with his incredible physical prowess, dodged, dodged, dodged, and continued to dodge the storm of blood hatchets coming at him from all directions. Still, unless he knocked them down, they would eventually catch up with him as they came flying at him endlessly.

However, Groovy is not so well behaved as to wait for that eventuality.

Groovy: [You're wondering when it's going to fucking end, aren't you? I'll give you the answer!"

As he said this, Groovy was not holding an additional blood hatchet, but the part of the severed weighted chain from the Kusarigama that was burned by the Yang Sword in the initial attack.

A specially engineered chain weight, it was briefly spun and thrown with arrow-like speed at Eugard's feet as he struggled to evade the blood hatchets.

Eugard: [――!]

Eugard turned his wrist to catch the chain weight with the middle of the Yang Sword.

It was a brilliant move on his part to immediately see the difference between that and a blood hatchet and decide that it would be safe to defend against it. However, there is nothing one can safely touch in the arsenal of The Master of Curse Tools Groovy Gumlet.

At the moment of impact, the chain weight glowed red and a tremendous explosion enveloped Eugard.

Eugard: [Ohhh――]

Tossed by the blast and flames, Eugard finally let out a distressed cry and was blown away. Nevertheless, Eugard straightened up his limp body and immediately tried to prepare for a follow-up attack.

Looking toward Eugard, blood hatchets swarmed the motionless target.

One blood hatchet can shatter bones, two can crush internal organs, and three or more can end a life.

Even Eugard could not withstand ten or twenty of them pouring down upon him.

Therefore, Groovy felt sure that he had killed him――,

Eugard: [――Stand tall. You are stronger than any of the Nine Divine Generals of my time.]

A moment later, Eugard's fearless face appeared before Groovy's eyes.

A slash from the Fiend Sword sliced off Groovy's right ear as he leaned forward, and a kick from his leaping opponent hit him in the midsection, sending him flying backward.

But, as he was being sent flying, Groovy undid his waistband, swung his Snakewhip Sword, made from a series of snake-man fangs, and began to cleave at the head of the pursuing Eugard.

Eugard: [If thou hadst been among the insurrectionists, the life of Mine Star may hath even been in danger.]

As it unwinded, the snakewhip sword unleashed a long, undulating blow akin to the body of a serpent.

Unsparingly dismantling it with the Fiend Sword as it approached him, Eugard appraised Groovy’s fighting strength by comparing it to his own experiences.

And as proof of his honor at that evaluation from the strongest Emperor in all history, Groovy aligned his feet, and fired two grappling locks from the cuff of his trousers in an attempt to shatter both shoulders of his opponent. 

Eugard: [Even under such circumstances, thou art as magnificent as ever.]

As the heels of his feet were whittled down by those grappling locks, Eugard delivered a kick to Groovy; coughing up blood due to that kick, Groovy ripped off the cloth wrapped around his neck, and unfurled it into the air.

For a moment, the line of sight between Groovy and Eugard was obstructed.

Groovy: [Go, fuck, yourSEEEEEL――!!]

From the one side of that unfurled cloth, Groovy flicked the magic crystal embedded in his throat, and hit Eugard with a surging roar that rumbled the very atmosphere.

From an unseen position, with an onslaught equivalent to sound itself, it was a surprise attack that was impossible to dodge.

But, against that sound, Eugard displayed the true ability of the Fiend Sword.

――“To get to the point”, there existed such a saying. 

It meant to get down to the heart of a matter, but everything had an appropriate “point”. No matter the object or phenomenon, or even concept, there existed a “point” that signified its essence.

The Fiend Sword Murasame, was an Enchanted Sword that cut through that perceived “point”.

Murasame hated Groovy, who had melted it down, and reforged it in the past, so in order to prevent his outstanding sense of smell from catching its scent, it cut the point of its “scent”.

Since then, it has become impossible for anybody to pursue the Fiend Sword Murasame by scent.

And here, Murasame had cut the surging roar that Groovy had unleashed.

Groovy’s eardrums heard the sound of the magic crystal embedded in his throat shattering, and the moment he realized that, the slash of the sword was about to cleave Groovy in twain――,

Groovy: [――――]

A sudden gust of wind had saved the life that should have been severed. 

???: [Deary me, that was a real close call. I was just takin’ a stroll and happened ta save yer life, fella.]

With all the Curse Tools he had sent forth for an emergency evacuation having been made powerless, Groovy’s life had been on the verge of eradication; carrying him, the tall figure who had unexpectedly appeared spoke in a laid-back tone.

Groovy was surprised by that sudden interloper, but Eugard could not not conceal his shock either.

Not only had he interrupted this fierce battle, but his presence drawing closer had not even been felt until this moment. 

Groovy: [Bashturd…]

???: [Ah, pushin’ yerself ain’t no good. It was the technique that got cut, but the effect is goin’ all the way ta yer voice. If ya try force yerself ta speak, you’ll never speak again.]

Responding to Groovy’s voice, which sounded like it was clotted with blood, the person who had perfectly ascertained what had happened―― the wolfman with black fur, let Groovy down.

Then, with his eyes that were as thin as threads, he looked over towards Eugard, who was glaring at him,

Wolfman: [I see. A Curse Tool that can chase ya down ta the ends of the world sure is useful, and yet ya made it powerless with a single arm. However…]

Pausing his words there, the wolfman watched as Eugard’s missing right arm grew back.

As the wolfman had said, the moment the storm of blood hatchets exploded, Eugard had pruned off the entirety of the right arm which had blood on its sleeve, and had managed to avoid it.

It was not as though that method of evasion had been outside of Groovy’s consideration, but if one lost an arm, their actions would dull accordingly. Even when keeping the fact that they were an undead in mind, that should not have changed.

Despite all that, Eugard displayed invariant movements before and after losing his arm.

That had been beyond Groovy’s expectations, and if not for the wolfman’s interference, he would have connected with a fatal opening that caused him to lose his life. ――But, what that meant was.

Groovy: [Oi, fuhgger.]

Wolfman: […Just now, did ya call me a fucker?]

Groovy: [Moar impohrtuntlee…Hk.]

Wolfman: [I know, I know. I’d be fully aware if ya didn’t tell me.]

Nodding at the appeal, the wolfman held his golden kiseru in his mouth, and extinguished the flame at its tip.

Then, while puffing out smoke, he slightly lowered the pitch of his voice and continued.

Wolfman: [Golly, guess there really was a caster with a nasty personality. ――There ain’t an ounce of love in ya.]

Seeing the same thing as the wolfman as he spoke those words, Groovy harbored a similar impression.

Eugard ascertained the feeling of his regrown right arm; holding the Fiend Sword in his left hand, the powerful Emperor of yore threw off the garment that had been singed by the explosion.

――The same “Curse of Thorns” that was upon Groovy and the wolfman, was also cast upon Eugard’s chest.
