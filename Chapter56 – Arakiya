*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Without being told by anyone. Arakiya swallowed it down.

Arakiya: [――――]

With great throbbing, the sound of flowing blood, was enveloped with pain.

That heartbeat pounded faster than it had during the midst of battle, with each thump of the heart becoming a shock akin to a nail being driven directly into the soul, which surged throughout her entire body. Yet, it eased Arakiya's mind.

Knowing that the heart still pumped blood, signified that she still retained her human form.

Even if it had been just a minor comfort akin to margin of error, it was necessary for Arakiya to keep herself from becoming stirred, to keep her soul from scattering.

――The unique existence known as The Spirit Eater in this world, composed solely of Arakiya.

Born from the delusions of individuals who could not be called researchers, but rather aberrants; the taboo existence of the Spirit Eater―― named Arakiya, had been kept alive as a sole being under a destiny shared with no one else in this world.

In a daringly diluted ego, Arakiya, who had clung only to the existence of the "pillar" that she deemed important to herself, had devoured spirits, acted as a formidable being, and fulfilled her role.

She had thought that was enough.

However, it was not as she had realized, upon losing said "pillar”.

Even if she had realized it, it was too late. If The Spirit Eater had ended as it should have, she would have resulted in an early collapse of the ego, consumed by the spirits she had absorbed, and her soul would have been painted over.

However, Arakiya did not meet that fate. Two factors could be considered.

One was that the individual Arakiya had deemed as her "pillar" was like a dazzling sun, shining so brightly that even when they were separated, they couldn't lose sight of them.

The other reason, and one that Arakia would never have admitted―― the days after being separated from the "pillar“, was the constant thunderous reminder of Arakiya's own existence, which shook her soul incessantly, evoking feelings of inferiority and stimulating her individuality.

Bathed in the light of the dazzling sun, accompanied by the incessant thunder, Arakia had preserved her own soul.

???: [――And, that is the conclusion I've come to, but I would like to hear if you have any awareness of it.]

Arakiya: [...No.]

It was the year when Arakyia surpassed Olbart in rank and was promoted to Second.

Chisha's opinion, based on his search relating to the remaining literature on the Spirit Eater, had etched a stern expression on Arakiya's face; the first time ever in their long acquaintance.

It was understandable. Chisha was intelligent, and his explanations were clear, but his perspective had been difficult for Arakiya to accept.

Arakiya herself only understood her existence as a Spirit Eater on a sensory level, yet she wanted to believe that her entirety was made entirely of Prisca.

She did not want that hopeful wish to be diluted by less desirable components.

To begin with――,

Arakiya: [...Why did you bring that up?]

As she questioned, it was surprising in itself that Chisha had broached such a topic.

Arakiya’s “pillar”, Prisca―― her exceptional escape from the Imperial Selection Ceremony, and being allowed to leave the country alive, was the most closely guarded secret within the Vollachian Empire.

At the time, it was natural for Arakiya and Chisha, who were involved in her exile, to know, but it had been a topic they had not spoken of for years, and something not to be mentioned to anyone else.

So why, at this moment, had Chisha chosen to bring it up?

Chisha: [I want to know whether you are a fragile, ephemeral, and vanishing existence or not. Whether I should count you among the numbers for the impending great battle that is yet to come.]

Arakiya: [...It makes no sense. I’m one of the Nine Divine Generals.]

It was only natural that they would have been sent to put down what Chisha and Vincent had predicted was a rebellion.

However, at Arakiya's response, Chisha's eye twitched downwards, forming an unusual expression on his face. It was a smile seldom seen from Chisha, who had almost always wore an expression of either blankness or bewilderment.

With that smile, probing Arakiya's vulnerability, Chisha continued.

Chisha: [The impending battle seems to be a little bigger than what you anticipate. I know that you do not truly serve His Excellency from the depths of your heart, nor do you consider us allies.]

Arakiya: [――――]

Chisha: [Even though I understand, it still stings a bit not to be denied.]

Arakiya: [...For the sake of the princess, I will not disappear.]

Without acknowledging Chisha's reaction as he touched his forehead, Arakiya ran her own hand over her eyepatch.

There was a reason why she was herself, a soul named Arakiya. The concerns Chisha had would not come to pass. It wasn't to reassure Chisha, she declared.

Arakiya: [Also, that has nothing to do with Cecilus.]

Chisha: [Fu. That's just my conjeeecture. If you really want me to admit that you are different, I would like to see Cecilus lose for once.]

Cecilus: [Huuuuuh? Weren't you talking about me just now? What's with Anya and Chisha treating me like I'm an outsider? That is not nice. Could it be about that one? About the slim chances of winning for Anya, who keeps extending her losing streak without learning her lesson?]

Arakiya: [Cecilus, die.]

Eventually, shortly after, a clash with Cecilus began, and Chisha, who wanted to avoid being involved, fled, so there was no opportunity to hear more about it.

Thereafter, there was no recollection of continuing the conversation with Chisha.

???: [――――]

Just a vague thought crossed her mind.

When would the looming great battle that Chisha was concerned about come? And when it did, would she be counted among the numbers?

If the opportunity arose, she would like to hear it.

Arakiya also had a long relationship with Chisha.

Due to their relationship stemming from the Imperial Selection Ceremony where she was separated from Prisca, Arakiya harbored unforgiveness towards Chisha, who was deeply involved in the reasons behind Prisca’s separation.

However, Chisha had taught Arakiya how to read and write. She owed him a debt. For that favor, she was willing to give Chisha the fight he wanted.

――Or perhaps, would this also be attributed to reasons other than Prisca?

She hated Cecilus. Vincent was complicated, but she leaned towards not forgiving him due to what happened to Prisca. Olbart was amusing with his jokes. Goz had an interesting face. Groovy had a sharp tongue but caring, while Moguro would listen without making unpleasant faces. She was not fond of Yorna, but couldn't bring herself to dislike her. Balleroy would occasionally take her for a ride on his flying dragon, and she felt like Madelyn and her tried to avoid seeing each other. She was grateful to Todd.

――Would all of these also be attributed to reasons other than Prisca?

???: [――――]

Feeling as though she might fall apart, torn to shreds, as if losing herself from the very edge of her memories, Arakiya gathered up fragments of "Arakiya“.

If she didn’t do that, her existence would disappear―― that wasn’t the case. 

Arakiya: [...ncess]

Without doing so, she wouldn't be able to restrain the tumultuous turmoil raging threatening to burst out within her.

It was tremendously colossal. Unbelievably heavy. Intolerably twisted. If left unchecked, it would destroy the Empire.

If she couldn’t keep it under control, her “pillar”――Prisca, wouldn’t be protected

That was why Arakiya, without being told by anyone, swallowed it down. Taking the Stone, Muspel, into her own incomparably thin and small body. 

She mustn't let the Empire be destroyed, manipulated by the monster who called herself a Witch, using this Great Spirit.

For that purpose――,

??? : [It seems you have ingested something unpleasant.――Truly, you are troublesome.]

The incessant thunder felt like a hallucination, piecing together a torn-apart soul.

Amidst the torment of the storm of pain and loss, Arakiya continued to gather up, patching together  "Arakiya”, resisting the dispersion of her turbulent existence.

Continuing to resist, enduring. ―― Clinging to the only possibility that stuck in a soul on the brink of destruction.

△▼△▼△▼△

The counting was growing tiresome, but it was their habit to do so.

Daring to go into the details of numbers could trivialize the reality one faced―― not to say that it would be a clever thing to do. Without such a mentality, it really was just a habit.

The habit of counting continued. ――This was the one hundred and ninety-first time.

???: [I'm just an ordinary dude, but this is so tiresome…]

Al muttered to himself as he felt the heat build up inside his helmet, sweat soaking the inside.

On the stage of the melted second bastion, the misadventures of the out-of-place bit actors continued. The atmosphere wobbled unsteadily due to the effects of the heat wave that engulfed the surrounding area, clearly transforming the space into something from a different dimension.

Humans would not be able to adapt to a world being remade into hell with every passing moment.

Trees and buildings were set ablaze, and sand and pieces of the street had begun to melt. His palm gripping the Blue Dragon Sword made a sizzling sound, and he was unsure if even his clothing would ignite at any moment.

In one moment, one could just be standing in this place, and in the next, they could be turned into a ball of flames. In fact, more than once, this had been the case.

In spite of such overly harsh circumstances――,

???: [Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta――!!]

The leading actor furiously ran over the bubbling, boiling magma, maneuvering at a speed that could have been mistaken for a lightning bolt.

With his disheveled, deep dark blue hair dancing, running with his bright pink kimono fluttering was Cecilus Segmunt, the flamboyant, self-proclaimed leading actor of the world.

His speed as he sprinted over the magma, the incredible leg strength that one would not expect from a slender child's legs, his seemingly inexhaustible stamina, and his courage to cross paths with an enemy that could remake the world in the blink of an eye, and the power of fate, are all first class.

Cecilus declared the world to be his stage and placed himself in the role of the leading actor. He was conscious of his appearance to an unseen audience and fulfilled himself in a way that did not shy away from these grandiose claims.

Who else could possibly mount a fight against such a powerful, extraordinary opponent?

Cecilus: [――Toh!]

Cecilus's body flew at an angle with a high-pitched shout characteristic of a child.

A moment after he lept, the ground where he had been just before swelled up and exploded from within. Taking advantage of the blast, Cecilus twisted in midair as he was ejected.

With that, a lightning kick that could blow away even a stone pillar as thick as a giant tree trunk flew toward the floating silver-haired dogperson―― Arakiya.

Arakiya: [――Ah, uh.]

With exposed brown skin, Arakiya's jewel-red eyes shed tears of anguish.

The soles of Cecilus's charred zori flew straight at her torso as she let out a cry, looming, looming ever closer―― at the moment of impact, a loud sound detonated in the sky.

Cecilus: [～～Hk!!]

Immediately afterward, Cecilus was slammed down faster than when he jumped up and plunged to the ground, bouncing furiously down the street, squelching a cry of pain as he raised his head.

A moment later, blood gushed from the small child's white forehead, turning his face red.

Cecilus: [Now this is a perfect match.]

He licked the blood that trickled down the well-shaped bridge of his nose and commented on the fact that he had been successfully defended against.

There was no surprise in that, because this was not the first time she defended against him.

Already a dozen or so times, Cecilus's lightning-quick attacks had been countered and continued to be shot down. As a result, the situation was rapidly becoming severely unfavorable.

Al: [Lil' Miss Arakiya, is a lot of trouble.]

While Al looked for an opening to intervene, he saw Arakiya floating in the air, distorting the space.

The Arakiya's appearance was even more bizarre than it had been just a few moments earlier, with magic crystals growing out of the thin girl's body as if poking through from within.

From a distance, the growths on Arakiya's arms and back resembled the wings of an angel.

The reality, however, was that an exceedingly large entity that Arakiya had absorbed was attempting to break through and spill out from the body of the girl in which it was trapped.

Al: [Fuck.]

As Arakiya's choice gradually eroded her power and made her deviate from her human form, Al could do nothing but curse and vent his uncontrollable anger.

He knew what it was like to want a way to compensate for his lack of power and fulfill his desires.

Al could imagine that Arakiya had the potential to achieve much greater heights than anything he had ever done and that there were numerous possibilities within his reach.

Nevertheless, by taking in something that did not suit her own ability, Arakiya's own brilliance would instead turn against herself, her surroundings, and the things she wanted to cherish.

The current situation is simply the answer to that apparent tit-for-tat question.

――Initially, Cecilus was the one who had the upper hand in the fight against Arakiya.

In order to hold back Arakiya, who had turned into a dangerous object that could blow away the second bastion and erase the entire Imperial Capital as it was, Cecilus set the stage by daring to strike her with stinging hostility and continuing to provoke her intuitive sense of danger.

To put it plainly, this was a battle of two transcendent beings who, as warriors, were not just one or two steps above but ten steps above.

Al had little room to intervene when he remained, but he was still able to prevent Cecilus's limbs from being blown off on two occasions out of close to two hundred attempts.

All the while, Arakiya was like an endlessly filled glass of water, spewing overflowing water at random, greatly endangering the lives of both Al and Cecilus.

Not to mention Al, who is using his cheat of his territory. But even if it is repeated, it would never be possible to grasp Cecilus bouncing around as a being outside of reason.

However, the conditions have changed.

This was due to the aforementioned increasing deformity of Arakiya, which immediately changed her fighting style.

Cecilus: [――Come on!]

Cecilus' eyes gleamed as he wiped the blood from his face, his voice bouncing, sounding warlike.

Instantly, the space around Cecilus distorted, and twisted pillars of stone burst out from all directions and attacked the boy like serpents. Cecilus crouched down, jumped away, and twisted to avoid the stone pillars that were furiously trying to snap at him, and the speed at which he leaped out of the way surged up to his top speed.

But Arakiya's tearful, anguish-filled onslaught did not let the lightning escape.
 
Kicking the ground and accelerating, Cecilus's path swelled, creating a series of huge stone and earth arms that grabbed the boy as if to crush him.

Cecilus: [Unfortunately, absolutely no touching of the actors on the stage!]

Saying so wittily, Cecilus made use of the swinging arm of the construct that swung down like a fly swatter as a foothold to break through and run up into the sky like a staircase. When he secured altitude, he reversed and used the stone fist that tried to strike him to jump to Arakiya again.

But――,

Cecilus: [You got me――!]

Cecilus screamed as he received a huge stone fist that would have turned him into a plume of blood if he had been a normal person, but he caught it with the bottom of his zori, killing the fatal impact with the spring of his whole body, and flew away with only the momentum he received.

As Cecilus surged toward Arakiya with the force of a ballistic missile, a white light was created in his line of attack, and Cecilus, with nowhere to run in the sky, dove toward Arakiya himself――,

Al: [Oooooh!]

With a howl, Al raised the Blue Dragon Sword and slammed the blade into Cecilus before he could jump into the light.

Instantly, after receiving a direct hit from the Blue Dragon Sword, the light flashed strongly for a moment, engulfing and obliterating the bodies of the approaching Al and Cecilus――,

×  ×  ×

Cecilus: [You got me――!]

Cecilus received the giant rock's fist with the bottom of his zori, only to steal its momentum, shouting as he flew like a ballistic missile.
 
Before his shout could be uttered, Al pointed the tip of his Blue Dragon Sword into the empty air, and,

Al: [Donaa!!]

Compared to Arakiya, the difference in their magic is like the difference between the moon and snot, but the stone shards produced ran through the sky and crushed the light of destruction that was about to be born.

For a moment, a strong flash burned Al's eyes even through his helmet, but it was not powerful enough to end Al's life much less Cecilus' speed.

Cecilus: [Al-san, let's do it!!]

The burst of light was instantly recognized to be his work, and Cecilus, having been relieved that his life had been saved, instantly swallowed his emotion and charged toward Arakiya.

His right hand is raised up in a chopping stance, with a sharpness that surpasses even a semi-famous sword. It flashed through the air, striking Arakiya, who had grown wings of magical crystals, diagonally――,

Al: [――Hk!]

At that moment, Al had a vision of an unexaggerated thunderclap and the sky being torn asunder.

In fact, it was not a vision. The shockwave from Cecilus' hand chop went out behind him and tore into a group of buildings on the verge of collapse and led to the collapse of the entire area.

But, however, the crucial part, Arakiya received the strike.

Arakiya: [――――]

Glaring, blood-red eyes moved to look at Cecilus, who was just a few feet away.

Arakiya, despite receiving a powerful blow on the forehead, maintained her hollow body without the slightest tremor, and in return raised her wings made of magic crystals,

Arakiya: [――――]

Immediately after those thin lips produced a faint sound, a blow fatally gouged Cecilus.

△▼△▼△▼△

Moment by moment, as time flowed, elapsed, passed, “Arakiya” was disappearing.

Gradually feeling her existence, the whereabouts of her soul being painted over, amidst the pain and anguish, Arakiya earnestly tried to recall the radiance of her Sun. 

An obstreperous existence she was. Despite having been created at the end of many sacrifices, she was indifferent to what had happened after she had been created, and was a hazardous material with nowhere to go.

While not knowing how to make effective or proper use of such a frightening being, that girl calmly lined Arakiya up adjacent to the life she was leading, and confidently told her to accompany herself.

Just why had she been able to try to oppose that perfected magnificence?

It should not have been possible for feelings of resistance or opposition to bud. That girl was the representation of what Arakiya believed to be correct, and her very existence was the meaning in Arakiya having been born.

In order to not let her lose that radiance, in order not to lose what she thought was beautiful about that radiance, she chose to leave her side thinking it was necessary, and somehow managed to endure the thought of being separated.

The reason she had endured, endured, endured it all, was because she believed that the Sun would rise once more.

――As long as she could protect the new day’s dawn, it would be fine if she herself could not bask in the rays of the rising Sun.

Recklessly crying out, whining that she could not get her hands on it, while eyes of disappointment were pointed towards her by none other than the Sun, that was when she finally arrived at this conclusion.

She thought she had been forsaken by the Sun.

She thought the Sun would no longer shine upon herself.

However, facing off in the decisive battle for the Imperial Capital, directing the Yang Sword towards a sobbing Arakiya, the Sun―― Prisca, had not cut Arakiya down with that treasured sword of crimson.

Afterwards, when surrounded by the servants of the Great Disaster that had appeared, she ought to have been able to flee. But, in exchange for Arakiya’s safety, she had chosen to be captured.

Those innermost feelings, that dazzling gleam, had not changed in the slightest.

If Prisca had remained unchanged, then Arakiya also wished for her oath to remain invariant.

――Prisca Benedict.

The Vollachian Empire’s symbol of a Sun that had set, yet would rise again.

When thinking of her, Arakiya could remain as “Arakiya”.

Arakiya could delay the limit for her soul growing hotter, and bursting apart.

However, even if her love and loyalty to Prisca was eternal, that limit could not be extended forever.

She detained a being that would engulf her, fully overtaking her presence.

While Arakiya continued to resist that disgrace to her mind, the being that was even now borrowing Arakiya’s body was amplifying its destruction in the real world to which she did not have room to turn her attention.

The destruction would only become more refined, the ruination would only gain more momentum, and a full collapse was only a matter of time.

Stagnating for a long period of however many centuries, the Stone did not pay any mind even if a part of its power was utilized in conflict between humans, nor if it was used for the enrichment of human activities―― when that had entered the fragile vessel known as Arakiya, it learned to resist against disappearing.

The Great Spirit that had been taken in by Arakiya was displaying defensive instincts that it likely would not have employed were it in its original form, and ironically enough, was strengthening its level of threat in order to protect the vessel of Arakiya.

Arakiya: [――――]

Somebody, somebody was fighting in order to stop Arakiya; she could feel it.

It seemed like because somebody was causing Arakiya’s power to be somewhat consumed, the brakes were being pulled on “Arakiya” fading away.

But, it was insufficient. Merely weakening her, merely keeping her in check, was insufficient.

In order to interfere with the objective of the Great Disaster, Arakiya had stuffed that into her cheeks.

The Great Spirit that would resign itself to the will of others no matter what was done to it, upon being taken in by Arakiya, learned of the fear known as losing oneself.

Only one push remained. After one more push, the Great Spirit would understand.

In order to keep “Arakiya” from disappearing, the Sun was required.

And, in order for “Arakiya” to fulfill her oath, something else was required. ――Thunder, was.

Somebody, somebody was fighting in order to stop Arakiya; she could feel it.

It was insufficient. That somebody, was insufficient. Just who in particular was needed, she knew.

That was why, while Arakiya was on the verge of bursting apart, she waited in hope.

――For Thunder, for reverberations of real Thunder, she waited in hope.

△▼△▼△▼△

Arakiya: [――Kill me, Cecilus.]

The moment he heard that, of all the things that could happen, his thoughts came to a standstill.

Slamming a karate chop into his opponent with all his might, he received a stare as if it had been utterly ineffective, and immediately after, as the beautiful girl sobbed out tears of blood, she made such an entreaty in a feeble voice. 

Cecilus: [――――]

Then, faster than he could swallow that mutter, Cecilus received a powerful blow to the chest.

The girl’s slender arms were essentially blades with the sharpness of the magic crystals densely growing on them, and alas, Cecilus’s slim chest was mercilessly cut open, staining his favorite kimono with blood as he fell.

Pain, was present. Awareness that he had blundered, was present. Signs of being in a huge pinch, were more than present.

However, more so than the wound that bore deep into him, more so than the blood drawing a trail through the air, he was unable to avert his gaze from the pitiful eyes and face of the girl from whom he was getting further away, unable to avert his gaze from the words that had been said――.

???: [■■!!] / [■■■■.] / [■●■●■●■.] / [■■■■●●■■.] / [●●●■■■.] / [――■■.] / [●●●●●!!] / [■■■●■●●■■●●.] / [●●…■.] / [●●■■●■■●●.] / [●■●■●■●■.] / [●●■●■●●●■■●――!]

Cecilus: [――My sincerest apologies but I beg you to be quiet!!]

That moment, Cecilus made a firm appeal to the incessantly audible voices of the audience.

???: [――――]

Normally, Cecilus would never do anything like silence the voices of the audience.

He would use the incoming voices as rousing ingredients to raise his own motivation, and at all times he would just calmly let it go in one ear and out the other as they spoke to him.

That, he had silenced. Quiet, even with the troublesome pain, he wished for quiet.

Cecilus: [――――]

While plummeting, Cecilus continued to stare at the girl amidst the silence without voices from the audience.

Suffering as she shed tears of blood, the girl’s appeals of sorrow took the form of destroying the world, and in the midst of groaning out cries that carried no meaning, she was finally able to mix her own desire in.

The fact that it had been none other than his own name, could undoubtedly be called a destiny of the leading actor.

However――,

Cecilus: [――“Kill me”, you said, that’s something I can’t let slide.]

More so than the pain or shock, he found it difficult to accept the way in which the words had been put together, so Cecilus clenched his teeth.

That moment, he bent his knees and rolled as he fell head-first towards the ground, and as he tried to secure a safe landing, he evaded, evaded, evaded the chain of stone pillars that targeted his landing, leaping as he grazed his heel across the ground.

And then, he lifted his head.

Cecilus: [I don’t think those words were meant for me.]

Of course, he did not think that there was anybody else present here who was called Cecilus.

However, he fully understood that the person to whom the crying girl had called out, to whom she had entrusted her wish, was not himself. ――That was overwhelmingly aggravating.

The most important bout, the gamble on which all was staked, the decisive scene, the time to rise to the occasion, any phrasing would do fine.

With such a moment, such a scene, such a climax having been prepared, there was no way it would be fine for the Cecilus Segmunt who was called out there to be somebody other than himself.

Therefore――,

Al: [――Cecilus! You, that wound…]

Cecilus: [I’ve made up my mind, Al-san.]

Having suffered a serious wound, Cecilus’s figure was shedding blood, and seeing that, Al uttered out a voice while fastening his Blue Dragon Sword to his neck, for some reason. Responding to him, Cecilus tore off a strip from his ripped kimono, and using it as a string, he tied back his disarrayed blue hair. 

Then, giving a smile, he looked up at the weeping girl―― at the heroine, and declared.

Cecilus: [Bear witness, Observers of the heavens above. ――Witness the choices the world shall make.]
